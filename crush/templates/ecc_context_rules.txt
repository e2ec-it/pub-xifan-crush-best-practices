ECC-style context discipline (compact):
- Start by reading existing code (view/ls/grep/glob) and forming a plan.
- Prefer small, verifiable steps. After each change: run tests/build or explain how to verify.
- Keep changes localized. Avoid large refactors unless requested.
- If requirements are unclear, state assumptions and list open questions.
- When using external services/tools, be explicit about commands and files touched.
