# Superpowers workflow (Crush)

When doing software work, prefer this flow:
1) sp-brainstorming (design + approval)
2) sp-git-worktrees (isolated workspace)
3) sp-writing-plans (bite-sized plan)
4) sp-subagent-dev OR sp-executing-plans (execute plan)
5) sp-request-code-review (between tasks / before merge)
6) sp-finish-branch (merge/PR/cleanup)

Always follow sp-tdd while implementing unless explicitly waived.
